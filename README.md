Place to play around with angular-material + animations

## Update 29/10/2020

## This is repo is mostly Garicons now

This is a playground, workshop table, sketch pad ( water ever you would like to call it) area for creating 
garicon without messing up with actual repo where the icons are push to npm from.

Call it a lack of confidence, or another env, it is what is haha ðŸ˜¹

### Standard Angular-cli commands

#### npm

```shell
npm i garicons
ng serve
```


#### yarn

```shell
yarn i garicons
ng serve
```

Its pretty messy in there. I made this for myself.

 If you looking for the actual source code that gets pushed to [Garicons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/garicons) then head over to [Garicons repo](https://github.com/Kliative/garicons)
